# Electronics-Design-Challenges
## Setup Instructions
Note: all setup instructions are using the terminal commands
1. Start by cloning this repository with the command
   `git clone https://github.com/huskyroboticsteam/Electronics-Design-Challenges.git`
2. Move into the folder cloned with `cd Electronics-Design-Challenges/`
3. You will need to create a branch so your work isn't colliding with other people's work. Your branch name should be of the format Firstname-Lastname e.g. Emela-Moreyra. Use the command `git checkout -b branhcname` and put your branch name where it says branchname
4. Now you need to make the initial push to set up your branch for everyone to view. Use this command replacing branchname with your branch's name: `git push --set-upstream origin brancname` After initially setting your upstream branch you should only need to use the command `git push` to push changes

Your branch should now be set up and ready for you to take on the challenges.

## Updating Your Branch From Master
When we post new challenges, the specifications document will be added to the master branch. In order to receive the new specifications on your branch you will need to pull changes using `git pull origin master`
